## An app for creating t-shirt mockups

## User Stories
MOCKED is an app for users to layout their design ideas onto t-shirt templates before going to a screen-printer. A user will start by choosing a t-shirt style, placement, and color. They can then upload their image, and adjust the size and positioning of the art to standard industry specifications. A user would also be able to add text to their t-shirt layout if desired.
